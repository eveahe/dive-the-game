## The Game
Explore the unknown depths of the deep ocean and the creatures that lurk there.

#### What is it?
A JavaScript REPL-style text-based adventure game engine, based on the [text-engine](https://github.com/okaybenji/text-engine) library, available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-engine) too -- see [text-engine-node](https://github.com/okaybenji/text-engine-node) for further info.

Text-engine has been adapted for the purposes of this specific game.

#### How do I use it?
Do you want to make your own game? Do it! Further directions in the [text-engine](https://github.com/okaybenji/text-engine) repo but here's a quick recap:
* Remix this glitch app. 
* `text-engine` uses a disk metaphor for the data which represents your game, like the floppy disks of yore. Including `index.js` from this repository in your `index.html` `<script>`s adds a single function to the global namespace: `loadDisk`. `loadDisk` accepts a single argument, which is your disk -- a standard JavaScript object (JSON).
* Map a map for your game and decide what the rooms, items and exits that are relevant -- and how players can move between the rooms. 
* If you want to add or edit the player commands, review the action list in `index.js` file.
